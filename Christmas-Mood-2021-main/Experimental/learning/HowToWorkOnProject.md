   ```git
   git clone https://github.com/kunaldesign/Christmas-Mood-2021.git
   ```

2. Start vscode and open folder(where you cloned you repo) </br>
   ![open folder](https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.BkoO9-PaitT-Xe55uW8awAAAAA&pid=Api&P=0&w=253&h=179)

3. Rename your Branch to your github username. </br>

   ```git
    git branch -m {your username}
   ```

4. Fetch your git to github.

   ```git
   git fetch origin {your branch name}
   ```
